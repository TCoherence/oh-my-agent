# Repo Rules

- When you add or change a user-facing default in `config.yaml.example`, also update the local `config.yaml` in the same change if that file exists in the workspace.
- Keep `README.md` as the primary English entry document at the repo root.
- Keep Chinese docs under `docs/CN/` and English detailed docs under `docs/EN/`.
- Do not add extra intermediate planning docs to the main docs tree; put historical or temporary material under `docs/archive/` if it must be kept.
